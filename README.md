# Contact Form HTML

Are you trying to make a website here on GitHub or somewhere else? Are you stumped on how you make a contact form for people to contact you from? Well, you've came to the correct place! As a programmer, I run into lots of problems, for example, how do I make a sign up page or login page? For that, you will need SQL.  

In this repository, I have created index.html. In there, there is all you need for making your contact page! Use it as needed.  

Bugs? Tell me in Issues! I'll reply ASAP.
